# BAN PREVENTION



***

This page explains how to prevent bans in other games.

### Quick Guide: <a href="#quick-guide" id="quick-guide"></a>

This must be done **before/after** playing games with an active anti-cheat.

1. 1.Turn off Fast Boot
2. 2.Shut down PC, unplug the power
3. 3.Plug PC back in, and restart it again upon logging in

Most of our tools are completely safe to have injected while you play. This may be true for COD, but for most other anti-cheats and games, it is not true. If you were to just close COD, and start Fortnite, you will be banned almost immediately. The same might be true if closing a game with an anti-cheat and immediately trying to start a tool. This is because the driver from our tool is still loaded on your PC.To unload our driver fully, you must restart your PC fully. This means turning off fast boot in your power settings, as well as unplugging the power. After that, start your PC and hit the restart button from the start menu. You will have restarted your PC twice by doing this. If you do not free the memory completely, there is a chance that it may still be detected by another game.We do not wish for anyone to be banned on other games, so please follow the above instructions to prevent this from happening.
