IF U GOT DISCONNECTED AFTER A 1-10 KILLS

\-Clean install windows (reinstall your windows) to make sure all tracer files are gone. A cleaner will not delete all tracer files.&#x20;

Also the kill disconnect in warzone 2 is based on a trust factor system and has many factors, like reports, level, paid mw2, kills you got in games before etc...&#x20;

If you get many kill disconnects it can also lead to a 24 hour shadow ban. Even legit players are affected

### you need really good trusted accounts with high level, played wz1 before, maybe mw2, not getting much reports etc.
