# Key Not Found

***

Most of the time, this error message is triggered by the loader having issues communication with our Authentication servers. The following steps should help to eliminate it.



* Use a VPN ([<mark style="color:yellow;">ProtonVPN</mark>](https://protonvpn.com/) is free)
  * This may be required for some people because of your firewall, or your ISP blocking the connection.
* Use the latest loader
  * You can always download the latest loader for whichever tool you need from the [<mark style="color:yellow;">Loaders</mark>](https://mega.nz/folder/TMdnAKRZ#mbjFVeivfJQozUvWo3IjRw) tab.
* Use a different network

Ensure that your key still has time left on it (Time of your sub counts down from its first activation in the loader). Remember that products which contain "+ spoofer" in the title do not mean you need to use the spoofer loader, it is built directly into the tool itself.
